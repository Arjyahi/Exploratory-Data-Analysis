## Severe weather events in the US and their impacts on public health and economy

Based on time series data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this study examines the severe weather events that have occurred in the United States (NOAA). The NOAA storm database not only keeps track of numerous events that occur across all US states, but it also offers details on injuries and property damage. The NOAA storm database is described in full at [this link](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/). Utilizing this data, the current analysis demonstrates unequivocally that while floods are more costly from an economic standpoint, tornadoes have the most detrimental effects on public health.
